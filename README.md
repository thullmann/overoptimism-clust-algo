# Overoptimism in Clustering

This is the repo for our paper "Overoptimism in Clustering".

## Overoptimism

We used optuna to find setting for popular synthetic datasets where the ROCK algorithm performed relativly best in comparison to DBSCAN, Kmeans, Mean-Shift and Spectral Clustering.
To simulate a reasearcher picking out the best datasets we <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e^{i \pi} = -1">
The code to each of the three datasets we tried can be found here:

- two moons
- blobs (with different densities)
- rings / circles

Our results and analysis can be found here:

## Analysis of each single parameter

To illustrate the effects of overoptimism in our paper we then used the three settings 

## Sensitivity towards random seed

## Hyperparameters
### ROCK 
### DBSCAN
